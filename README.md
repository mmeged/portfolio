# About me
My name is Michelle Meged (she/her/hers) and I'm a Master of Arts Management student at CMU ('21). I grew up in Los Angeles but spent the last 13 years in New York City before moving to Pittsburgh for school. While working in Visitor Services Departments throughout the city's museums, I received my bachelors in Media Studies from NYU. My senior thesis was on Instagram, the creation of the mediated self, and the fan-celebrity parasocial relationship. I believe that the arts should be made accessible for everyone, so I'm interested in breaking down the barriers to arts participation. I also make collages out of vintage magazines, and really value having an outlet for creative expression.

# What I hope to learn 
One of the main reasons I chose to go to Heinz was for its data-driven focus (which is admittedly not my strong-suit!). But the truth of the matter is that non-profits are subject to the same modes of analyses as for-profit ventures, and investors and funders are increasingly looking for data about who an orgaization serves, how they go about reaching them, and what their ROI is. Being able to communicate these considerations accurately, clearly, and thoughtfully is critical to ensuring an organization's sustainability and success. And as a visually-based person, I look forward to learning more about the methods and strategies that can impart that information through color, scale, layout, and format.

# Data Visualization Critique and Revisualization 7/22/20

[Original](https://controller.phila.gov/philadelphia-audits/revised-fy21-fy25-budget/#/spending)

![Philadelphia FY21 Revised Budget](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67839182/88245907-dc1f7100-cc66-11ea-84db-76f767207f55.png)

1. Critique: I selected this visualization because it represented a topic of specific interest. Since I follow Arts and Culture Twitter, I already knew that Philadelphia’s revised FY21 budget had eliminated their Arts and Culture department. But I didn’t know that the city’s Controller created a visualization of the budget as a tool of transparency, so I was excited to check it out. While I appreciated its thoroughness, it seemed to leverage that thoroughness to hide the real impact of the budget revision. Because there are so many bubbles, it is easy to miss entire categories if you’re not taking the time to explore everything. It is also easy to miss classes. For example, there are three classes within every department: materials/equip, personal services, and purchase of services. Parsing them out by class (instead of department) undermines the extent of the budget changes. Someone might hover over the bubble I selected and think Arts, Culture, and the Creative Economy was only defunded by $7,000, when the total defunded amount is actually over $4 million. I also feel like the shaded colors are misleading, since the differences in very light green and very light red and largely imperceptible. It is difficult to look at this visualization and realize that the budget for Police was increased at the same proportion another department was defunded (or eliminated).

2. Process: I decided to use the data to tell a specific story. Instead of sharing everything like in the Controller’s model, I wanted to tell the impact of these revisions – impacts that were obscured by a lumped group of bubbles.

I was immediately drawn to the idea of the unit chart so that people could really see what the disparity in funding looked like (i.e. lots of blocks = lots of money, vs "WOW NO BLOCKS AT ALL?!). Unfortunately I grappled with finding a good unit of measurement. A $10 million square does not scale down to any meaningful shape or size for $45,000. Also, how would I graphically represent $0 for Arts and Culture? Both people I showed this to expressed difficulty comprehending the metric (block to dollars). They also felt the subtitle and the categories were exposing a bias of the chartmaker. While I was definitely interested in creating a particular narrative, I definitely didn’t want to convey bias.

This was another way I explored communicating that disparity. Both viewers expressed surprise at these findings (which was great news for me because it meant I got a crucial point across). But they also expressed interest in seeing other departments; they felt like they were missing a part of the picture.

While I received critique for my crummy crowding on the x-axis, both of my reviewers got the point of this graph without feeling there was exceptional bias. One person did ask if there were other departments than the ones included here. And the other wondered if there was any particular order to the way the x-axis was arranged.

Solution: 

Through this process, I realized what I really wanted to convey to the audience was two elements – firstly, the disproportionate amount of spending on police, and secondly the consequences of the revised budget. None of my wireframes had adequately conveyed both of those messages simultaneously, so I combined elements of the the second and third graphs without adding too much clutter.

I think the scale between police and everything else is immediately apparent. I grouped the x-axis categories so that related items were near each other (i.e. Police, Prison, and Sheriff are “grouped” at the start of the graph). I revised the heading to include “Snapshot” to be transparent that there were other categories, and tried to create a less incendiary subheading to temper my obvious bias. I also added a call-out to the Arts and Culture category because I really didn’t want that to get lost.
