HERE WE GOOOOO

# About me
My name is Michelle Meged (she/her/hers) and I'm a Master of Arts Management student at CMU ('21). I grew up in Los Angeles but spent the last 13 years in New York City before moving to Pittsburgh for school. While working in Visitor Services Departments throughout the city's museums, I received my bachelors in Media Studies from NYU. My senior thesis was on Instagram, the creation of the mediated self, and the fan-celebrity parasocial relationship. I believe that the arts should be made accessible for everyone, so I'm interested in breaking down the barriers to arts participation. I also make collages out of vintage magazines, and really value having an outlet for creative expression.

# What I hope to learn 
One of the main reasons I chose to go to Heinz was for its data-driven focus (which is admittedly not my strong-suit!). But the truth of the matter is that non-profits are subject to the same modes of analyses as for-profit ventures, and investors and funders are increasingly looking for data about who an orgaization serves, how they go about reaching them, and what their ROI is. Being able to communicate these considerations accurately, clearly, and thoughtfully is critical to ensuring an organization's sustainability and success. And as a visually-based person, I look forward to learning more about the methods and strategies that can impart that information through color, scale, layout, and format.
