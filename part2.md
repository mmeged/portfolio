# The Audience

My audience is the general public. Not a scientist or astronomer, someone who’s maybe intrigued by UFOs, has watched sci-fi movies and tv series, but by-and-large skeptical and dismissive of UFOlogy as a fringe science that preoccupies the minds of conspiracy theorists.

I wanted to “de-fang” this armor. So I started by contextualizing UFOlogy within a series of larger phenomena that have likewise been dismissed throughout history but later were proven true. I wanted them to give the issue an open mind. I also tried to reveal a really reasonable ask. The experts believe it’s worth studying, so they should be able to without losing face or being ridiculed. The results of that kind of study could reap immeasurable benefits.

# Updating Charts

Chart revisions: To streamline the narrative and ease legibility, I updated and refined a few charts. I standardized the pie charts to maintain consistency. Unfortunately, the two Astronomer charts didn't work well in my Shorthand narrative (and Datawrapper wouldn't let me edit the heading color, or add an opaque background to ease legibility), but I really wanted to maintain that consistency in style so I took a screenshot of it and uploaded that to Shorthand. This is what they look like as embedded code: 

<iframe title="Asking the Public: Does Extraterrestrial Life Exist?" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-eS2D7" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eS2D7/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="437"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

<iframe title="When asked if the UFO problem deserved scientific study, Astronomers answered:" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-JX9EH" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JX9EH/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="476"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

I also changed my approach with the "government trust chart." First, I changed the colors so that "hide from the public" would be the color the reader sees more quickly, since that’s the information I wanted the reader to see first. I edited the categories so there wouldn’t be so many, combining a few of the age ranges and eliminating the regional distinction (the feedback I got from my reviewers mentioned being surprised at the other metrics but the regional one didn’t seem to leave an impression either way.) Lasty, I moved this chart from the end of the narrative and grouped it with the other charts based on public opinion. I felt this made more sense.

One reviewer was also confused by my point that 4.6% of astronomers witnessed inexplicable aerial phenomena; since it was such a low figure, she thought I was undermining my own point. By expanding on that point through narrative and a clear infographic, I believe the correlation I was trying to make became more identifiable.

# The Work

My biggest obstacle for this assignment was not having the raw data for my original story on diversity in museum leadership. I know the data exists, as I’ve read reports on the industry’s problem on this specific issue. But I didn’t realize those raw figures were not available until I was in it too deep, and then I was grasping at straws. I contacted the Carnegie Library and was connected to a database that had insufficient data; I reached out to a woman who visited my class last year and spoke on this issue, and she wasn’t able to give me access to it either. I know the assignment stresses to make sure to have the data first, but I underestimated how often/thoroughly that data is just not readily made public. It really made me consider why so much data is kept private when transparency is such an important value.

My next obstacle was finding another topic that I was both a.) interested in and b.) capable of accessing the data. A couple topics, like how many people now find love online, had their data stored in files I couldn’t figure out how to open (regardless of how many tutorials I watched). Once I landed on the UFO sighting registry, I thought I finally found something I could work with. If anything, it would pique people’s interests for being a bit of an oddball topic (with some neat photos to illustrate it to boot).
Now that I had that data, I had to figure out what to do with it. This was another struggle – finding the “so what.” Luckily talking it out with other people was very beneficial to envisioning the story arc, and I went on a hunt for more data to bolster that narrative. I know we didn’t cover timelines in class, but I hope it’s a visualization that works in my context

I sort of dreaded creating a story board, but it was probably the most helpful element to the assignment. It helped me stop and piece everything together thoughtfully. For some reason I had trouble with Balsamiq and wasted too much time creating boxes and dropping in images before I gave up and just drew the analogue version.
Once I had my storyboard and prototype charts created, I sent them out for feedback. If I were able to do this again, I think I would have given less context and asked more directed questions. The people I reached out to seemed excited about my story, but not very critical. The critique assignment we did in class (where we had to revisualize another data viz and solicit feedback) provided more specificity about where my charts needed clarification. The critiques I got this round did help me realize where my narrative was failing, but I didn’t get as much feedback on the charts themselves – and I know those needed work!

I really enjoyed playing around with Shorthand. It was not the most intuitive tool to me, and I had trouble getting some charts to display properly. Maybe this is something I could have figured out if I had more time. But regardless, I think the effect is stunning and swanky and I’m grateful to have had the opportunity to experiment with it.
